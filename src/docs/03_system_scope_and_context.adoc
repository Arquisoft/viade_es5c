== System Scope and Context


[role="arc42help"]
****
The project we are going to develop consists of a decentralized route management system.

However we have to focus on permissions. A user cannot see the routes of another user if he has not received permission, that is, if they have not shared the route with him.

The most important point of our system is decentralization. We want only the users who create the routes to have access to them, so that no external user can access.

To archive this goal we will use SOLID. SOLID is a project that consist of a descentralized website. With this we intend that users can store their routes in PODs. A POD is a unique profile of each user, which allows to store information on the web about it.

We will use POD to store the route of each user.


.What  we work with /TODO
Here we describe the programs that we had decide to use.
* JavaScript
* React
* Solid

=== Business Context

[role="arc42help"]
****

The communicated parties are the stakeholders that can be anyone who wants to have a conversation with this app. There are also the PODs of each of the users that will be used to save the data.

The interface will receive the path of the user using the application and save it to the userâ€™s PODS. Communication with Solid and the POD will be received in the application using the Javascript React framework.


Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

=== Technical Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
The implementation of the application has been carried out with react. It has a user interface in which the user will be able to save his routes and in addition to that will be able to share images with other users that he decides

After start a conversation, the messages of the app are stored in a private folder within the POD of each person, stored in order and using the necessary turtle system to store the information of each message

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.
