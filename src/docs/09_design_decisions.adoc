=== Design Decisions Detailed

In this document we will show the decisions regarding the design that we have found most accurate and which directly influence our project. 

As the project progresses, it is possible that the tools we initially decide to use change, to facilitate the way we develop our application.

==== Front End

For the design of the user interface and give the most similar aspect possible to the applications with which we handle daily we have decided to use HTML, CSS in addition to JQUERY.
Our decision is given so that the user can feel more comfortable having an appearance similar to other applications with which he is more familiar.
Using React was not a team decision, it was a requirement. Even so, some of the advantages that React offers us are increase application performance, easy to integrate with frameworks such as Meteor, Angular, etc.

==== Back End

For the system functionality and data processing part, we will focus on using javascript with nodeJS. Since it is an environment that we know, easy to use and above all because in a project of these characteristics we can take advantage of the advantages it offers, such as scalability and consume data in real time.

The tests will be carried out with Jest, a framework for testing javascript that focuses on simplicity.

==== Routes storage

In order to save our users' routes, we were restricted from using SOLID. The window that you have on other databases is that it helps us to save the data without having to have a main database and that helps to improve the privacy of users, storing individual routes in PODS. In addition, SOLID with its basic principles of OO programming and design helps to develop quality and easily testable software.

==== MVC

Our application follows the MVC pattern (controller view model). This pattern is based on the ideas of code reuse and layer separation, features that facilitate development and maintenance tasks.

==== Continuous Integration

We are using Travis CI for running the tests and checking the correct build of our app, Codecov for improve our code review workflow and quality. Also Code Quality to improve our skills when programming a better and more robust code.

==== Google Maps API
We decided to use the Google Map API due to the many advantages it provided us, such as examples of carrying out tasks similar to those proposed in the subject and the ease of implementation and work with it, apart from many other advantages such as It can be reliability, scalability and flexibility.

==== LDFlex
I use the LDFlex given the simplicity with which it allows us to make queries about a POD to extract the data we need to use it in our application.

==== JQuery
Using JQuery, since it is a comfortable and effective way to manage the DOM tree without having to use template engines. Furthermore, the working group has experience in its use.

==== Documentation

Regarding the documentation, we will do it in asciidoctor, since it is open source and uses a simple syntax and includes very useful functionalities such as being able to reference a code section of another file.
