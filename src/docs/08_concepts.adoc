=== Concepts Detailed

==== Domain concepts
In the application we wil have this domain concepts:

* Route: the route the client want to share or save.
* POD: where the data is going to be store.
* Client: use the application to save or share route,image,etc...

==== UI/UX
The user interface is written with React, it might be in English, and is the design of the app. For user experience is very important. We want the user to use it easily, and comfortably, without any problem.

==== Patterns
The decentralized routes management system follows de MVC (ModelViewController) architecture pattern.

==== "Under-the-hood" Concepts
* Persistency: data is always persistent in every user's pod.
* Exception and error handling: The main error not controlled by the app is having a not stable internet connection as it could damage the appâ€™s correct functioning.
* Reporting: we will use a system to compute changes and code coverall (maybe Travis).

==== Development concepts
* Build: to build our app we will use NodeJS webpack
* Test: we will use some frameworks to try our app. Some of them could be mocha or cucumber.js
* Deploy: Our app will be deployed using Docker.

==== Safety and security concepts
* Safety:
	The application won't be open to vulnerabilities.
* Security:
	All will be save in the POD, so the user could be the only one who can get it, and the application will be descentralized.
