== Quality Requirements

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios.

.Motivation
As quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural decisions, we should know what is important for every system's stakeholder.

=== Quality Scenarios
In this point, we'll talk about the most important points:

1. Reliability (HIGH): this is the most important point in this project. The app must be mostly all the time working. Even if a Pod provider fails to work (solid for example) the user is able to login with other provider, so the app will continue running.
2. Performance (HIGH): users must have the better experience possible. Loading time is improved how much we could in the short period of time we had to develop this project.
3. Security (MEDIUM): the app must be secure to use. One of the reasons Solid is chosen is because your data is always secure
4. Modificability (MEDIUM): this quality scenario is very important for us, just because you don't know who will continue with this project in the future, so it has to be easy to modify. 
5. Testability (HIGH): We are using Codecov for code coverage, ensuring it at least reaches 60% of code coverage.
6. Usability (HIGH): If possible we want to add images to the routes, giving the users a better experience with our app.
7. Availability (HIGH): This route system will be available to anyone who has a Solid account and a Solid Pod to store user information. Also, the user could have an Inrupt Pod
