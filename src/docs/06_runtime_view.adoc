=== Log in

* The user runs the application:

** Subscenario 1: The user doesnt have a POD, they have to sign up to either Inrupt or Solid Community. 

** Subscenario 2: The user does already have a POD, but they are not logged in, then they select their provider and enter the credentials.

** Subscenario 3: The user has a POD and is logged in, in this case the user can use the application from the get-go.

=== Share routes

1. First User_1 share a route to User_2

2. The application of the User_1 posts its route on the pod of the User_2

3. The application of the User_2 requests the shared routes that contains its pod, so the pod makes the routes available for the application

4. The application of the User_2 requests the received routes that contains its pod, so the pod makes the routes available for the application

5. Finally User_2 view the received routes from the application
