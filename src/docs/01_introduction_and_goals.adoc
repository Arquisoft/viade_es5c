== Introduction and Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****

This project is based on a decentralized route management system based on the SOLID specifications.

* Project developed using the React and SOLID framework

****

=== Requirements Overview

[role="arc42help"]
****
* The system will be based on a decentralized architecture in which the data is separated from the application
* Users can store the routes on their own pods.
* Users can view the routes on a map.
* The application will allow the user to share photos, videos or other files with other friends.
* A user can get notifications when a friend wants to share a route with him.
* Users may have groups of friends with whom they may want to share a route.
* It should be possible to see the routes loaded by users who are using a different app, so that interoperability with other route management systems should be taken into account.

|Priority|Goal|Description
|1| _Privacity_ | _To secure the user data, to make then able to manage their own data as they wish._
|2| _Usability_ | _To make able to non-technical persons or those related to the technological field may understand the use of the system_
|3| _Funcionality_  | _So that a good use of the system can be made respecting the two superior objectives, without any problem._
|4| _Efficiency_  | _The system should make able to share and upload your routes in the lowest possible time._
