== Introduction and Goals
This project is based on a decentralized route management system based on the SOLID specifications.

* Project developed using the React and SOLID framework

=== Requirements Overview
* The system will be based on a decentralized architecture in which the data is separated from the application
* Users can store the routes on their own pods.
* Users can view the routes on a map.
* The application will allow the user to share photos, videos or other files with other friends.
* A user can get notifications when a friend wants to share a route with him.
* Users may have groups of friends with whom they may want to share a route.
* It should be possible to see the routes loaded by users who are using a different app, so that interoperability with other route management systems should be taken into account.

=== Quality Goals

The main goals of the sistem are:

|Priority|Goal|Description
|1| _Privacity_ | _To secure the user data, to make then able to manage their own data as they wish._
|2| _Usability_ | _To make able to non-technical persons or those related to the technological field may understand the use of the system_
|3| _Funcionality_  | _So that a good use of the system can be made respecting the two superior objectives, without any problem._
|4| _Efficiency_  | _The system should make able to share and upload your routes in the lowest possible time._

|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| _Users_| _Use the app to record their routes_ | _To safe their data safely, and to be owner of their data, using the app to record their routes_
| _Inrupt_ | _Company who are gonna try the app, to evaluate it_ | _Obtain a decentralized and secure route application using SOLID specifications built by students._
| _Team Developer_ | _Team who will create the app_ | _Create a good application at the same time that they learn new technologies._
| _Teachers_ | _They will mark our project and the way we have presented the architecture of the project._ | _They will need to be able to understand our project functioning and architecture. They will be expecting a fully functional proyect that will make the university proud of their students._
| _Maintenance Team_ | _Team that will maintein the app if its successful_ | _A clean, and eficient code for the application_
